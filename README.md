About me:
Graduate of Dartmouth College and Boston College Law School
Practiced law for six years representing whistleblowers alleging fraud against the government
Qualified for and was prepared to run the Boston Marathon 2020

Initial goals:
Analyze 2020 proposed age grade standards for the marathon.
Look at standards in real world context (e.g. Boston Marathon 2019).
Check validity of age-grading system.

 What I found:
Age-grading standards do not need to be fixed; Boston Marathon qualifying times do.
Boston Marathon qualifying times are unequal across gender & ages.

RECOMMENDATION: Proposed Boston Marathon qualifying times should be updated using age-grading.

Part I :  Age-Grading
Definition:
•	A statistical attempt to measure the strength of an athlete’s performance relative to his/her gender & age.
•	A runner’s finish time is compared to an “ideal” score (the “age standard”) achievable for his/her gender & age.
Terms:
•	Open Standard: fastest known time
•	Age Factor: number less than 1, a point on the curve
•	Age Standard: close to fastest known time for someone of that age
Expression:
•	Age-Graded Time = Finish Time x  Age Factor
•	Age-Grade Percentage = Age Standard / Finish Time

What age-grade results should look like
•	Actual finish times expected to show positive correlation between age and time.
•	Age-graded finish times should show no correlation.
